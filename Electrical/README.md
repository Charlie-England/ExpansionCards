 - KiCad_templates - These are templates with the PCB outline and some basic components
   to let you get started with a card design quickly.  You can copy the folders inside to
   the default template directory: https://docs.kicad.org/5.0/en/kicad/kicad.html#template_locations
 - Microcontroller - A reference project using a SAMD21 Microcontroller with some pin
   headers broken out.  **Note:** We've built and done basic validation on an older version
   of this design, but the version currently in this repository is untested.
