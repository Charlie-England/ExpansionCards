There are a few variants of mechanical CAD that we have released:

 - OpenSCAD - This is a parametric model using OpenSCAD (https://openscad.org),
   designed to be easy to edit and 3D print.
 - Printable - There are 2D drawings and 3D CAD of an lid-less card enclosure
   that is designed to be easy to either 3D print, CNC, or injection mold.
   There is a version designed for use of self-tapping M2 screws, and also a
   version that can accomodate M2 threaded inserts.
 - Retrofit - This is a 2D drawing for a PCB that can be retrofit into existing
   Expansion Card cards sold by Framework.
